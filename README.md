## How It Works

**Input or Trigger** — The user specifies the list of Snapchat profiles whose stories should be viewed.

**Core Logic** — The automation tool starts the viewing process, navigating through the stories, and logs actions for analysis.

**Output or Action** — Stories are viewed in sequence with a controlled delay to mimic human interaction, ensuring smooth operation without triggering Snapchat's anti-bot measures.

**Other Functionalities** — Provides detailed reports after each run, including success and failure metrics.

**Safety Controls** — Features like randomization of intervals and user-agent spoofing reduce the risk of detection, while logging ensures the tool's activity is traceable.
